EC 602 Mini Project 2
								Cybersecurity

Blockchain has been in a hot discussion in the past few years and that "enthusiasm" does not seem to be relieved at all. First being introduced for the rise of Bitcoin, blockchain has been adapted more in security area, especially there is a third parties involved. 

1.	Introduction
Let us take a brief look at blockchain technology. To understand what blockchain is and what it could do, the concept “decentralization” should be introduced first. “decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, economics, money and technology.” This is the definition of decentralization, quoted from Wikipedia. Blockchain technology is an application of decentralization which create a series of network connect nodes and each of them is distribute. Every time a person commits changes in their “space”, the information is recorded and no one could edit it.

2. Summary of the reference
	Nowadays blockchain has spread beyond finance, which is the are that it initially been applied.
It is widely used in management, e-governance, online voting and other sectors. Open source blockchain platforms are built which enable developers and enterprise to create and establish their own decentralized storage system that could solve many current problems. There are many open source blockchain projects including: Hyperledger, Enterprise Ethereum and Corda,etc.

2.1 Hyperledger
	Having realized the potential of blockchain technology, The Linux Foundation gathered a group of cross-industry executives to found the Hyperledger Project. This is a blockchain free open source platform which offers wide-ranging tools and frameworks for developers to create enterprise-focused solutions. Under the Hyperledger umbrella, an enterprise can experiment with blockchain platforms aimed at creating solutions across all industries.

2.2 Enterprise Ethereum
Enterprise Ethereum is a platform that allows developer to create blockchain solutions and mainly focus on enterprise customers. This platform enables enterprises to create their own decentralized applications. The major advantage of using Enterprise Ethereum are highly customizable. Enterprise users can create applications that fit their own demand and it will perform better, interact directly and securely, in a lower cost of trust.

2.3 Corda
	Corda is another popular blockchain platform, especially since it puts strict emphasis on the privacy of the information concerning transactions among peers. Corda is business oriented. It is underlined by the ability for developers to create blockchain networks which are interoperable but with the strict privacy policy. Companies using solutions built on Corda can transact directly. The nodes interact on a peer-to-peer basis, which facilitates the sequencing of transactions without global broadcast. Specifically, Corda has Apache as an open source license.

3. Pros and Cons
3.1 pros
There is a key feature that makes blockchain so appealing, which there are no central authority playing a important role between peers. Therefore peer interaction remains safe and secure. In addition each node is distribute when accessing information and bad actors could not tamper the data unless they bypass the robust system. One of the most essential advantages of blockchain is that once data has been committed to the public, no user can change it anymore.
3.1 Cons
	Although blockchain is a effective application and solves many problems existed, it still has multiple obstacles standing in its way. One of the most massive drawback is that blockchains use excessive energy. The energy that uses up to create the next block is too high that somehow is unacceptable comparing to the output. This process is energy consuming and it could become a considerable issue for all application that use blockchain technology, which could not be ignored.
4. Recommendations
	I would recommend that a enterprise user to uses Hyperledger and Enterprise Ethereum which has a variety of applications and flexible customized developing environment. Just like many other blockchain application, these two are smoothly used and open source therefore has a pluggable framework which enables enterprise customers to utilize easily.
5. Conclusions
Storage systems based on the idea of decentralization and blockchain technology has been briefly presented. The open sourced applications also provide solutions on pros and cons of blockchain. The key is to Cybersecurity based on blockchain still needs further analysis and there will be more advantages and drawbacks appears in the future works.
